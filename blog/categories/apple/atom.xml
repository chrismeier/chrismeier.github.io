    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Being a fan of the flat design iOS 7 design I wanted to try and make my computer feel a little more “flat”. My first step was to make my app icons on my Dock flat. Below is the end result and what follows is how you can do it.

<h3>1. Find the image that you want to use</h3>

<p>Obviously you can use any image you want but the easiest way to find one is to search google for icons and in this case “Safari flat icon”.

<h3>2. Get the right image</h3>

<p>You want to make sure the image is actually an icon and not an image with a white background. When you click the image result you are able to tell if it the image has a transparent background by the fact that it has a checkered backdrop (see below). Once you have found the image that you want click view image (as highlighted below) and then right click and save the image you see in the new page.

<h3>3. Apply the icon</h3>

<p>Go to the application that you want to apply the icon to. You can view your applications by opening up finder and clicking the Applications folder in the side menu. Once you have found the Application that you want to apply the icon to right-click it and select “Get Info”. Next, click the icon in the Get Info pane (see below). You should now see it highlighted in blue. Now, press <i>Command+V</i> to paste your icon over the old one.</p>

<p><i>Note: You will need to restart your computer OR restart Finder and Dock (Terminal commands “killall Dock” and “killall Finder”) in order for the icons to go into effect.</i>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since upgrading to Mavericks I have found the Apple Mail app to be incredibly buggy. Mail often takes 5-10 minutes longer than it takes for it to arrive on my phone or within the browser client. There are also other instances where the mail process will spike to 200% &ndash; 500% CPU usage according to the iStat Pro widget. This doesn’t effect the performance of the rest of the computer but it is a huge drain on my battery. Additionally, from time to time the fans will spin up to 6000 RPM’s and my normally quiet Macbook Pro is now competing with a professor for the loudest thing in the room.</p>

<h3>Alternate 1: Mail Pilot</h3>

<p>Until that is fixed (and I did look to see if there was something I could do) I have chosen to use another mail app. My first choice became the Kickstarter success <a href="http://www.mailpilot.co">Mail Pilot</a>. It is one of those email clients that focuses on turning your email into a to-do list and aims for inbox zero.

The mobile app looks great (at least from the app store pictures) but unfortunately the desktop version is currently in beta and is slow to roll out. So option 1 is on the back burner for now.</p>

<h3>Alternate 2 Part 1: Air Mail</h3>

<p><img class="img&mdash;right" src="/images/BlogImages/AirMailFolders.png" title="&lsquo;Air Mail Folders&rsquo;" >
The next client I came across is called Air Mail. It is a fairly simple looking client with a lot of customization as far as how you want it to look.  It is has a clean feel to it but also has a weird color thing going on with the various folders in your mail box.<br/>
The speed compared to apple mail is night and day, everything from pulling in mail to opening up a random folder it is incredibly quick. The inbox also has gesture support, two-finger swipe-right to archive and swipe-left trash the item. Bottom line is that Air Mail has a familiar feel compared to Apple Mail but is much quicker and doesn’t kill my battery.</p>

<h3>Alternte 2 Part 2: Mailbox App</h3>

<p>Since Mail Pilot was my first choice I considered getting their mobile app but decided instead to wait for the desktop version before investing $14.99 in their ecosystem. A competitor to Mail Pilot, <a href="http://www.mailboxapp.com">Mailbox</a>, was also picking up a lot of attention and is very similar in functionality so I am currently giving that a shot as well. Mailbox also has a to-do list/inbox zero approach to email and as an added benefit you get an extra 1GB in Dropbox.</p>
